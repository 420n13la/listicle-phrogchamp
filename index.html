  <h2>I've been playing Pokemon for many years now, and the amount of pokemon, short for "Pocket Monsters", there is, is pretty signifcant. As one of the biggest video game fracnhises in the world, Pokemon has always been targeted to a younger audience, but it has fans of all ages! Personally, my favourite pokemon of all time is Lotad, a small blue 6-legged chunker with a lilypad as a hat, and to celebrate his recent appearance in the new Pokemon Sword and Shield games, here is a list of reasons of why I believe he is the best.</h2>
